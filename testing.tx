Throughout this book, we’ll be applying a number of testing techniques that serve to ensure that our example code
operates as intended, as well as to serve as examples of how to test general code. The primary tool that we’ll be using
for testing is an assert() function, whose purpose is to assert that a premise is either true or false. The general
form of this function is:

assert(condition, message);

where the first parameter is a condition that should be true, and the second is a message that will be displayed if it’s
not. Consider this, for example:

assert(a == 1, "Disaster! a is not 1!");

If the value of variable a isn’t equal to 1, the assertion fails, and the somewhat overly dramatic message is displayed.
Note that the assert() function isn’t an innate feature of the language (some languages, such as Java, provide such
capabilities), so we’ll be implementing it ourselves.
